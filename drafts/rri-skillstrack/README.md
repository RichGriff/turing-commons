# Responsible Research and Innovation Skills Track

> **About this document**
> This directory contains all of the drafts under development for the Turing Commons, including blogs, modules, activities.

All drafts are formatted using HackMD's slides functionality. While we do not use HackMD for presentation, please follow this formatting to ensure the following:

* The material is written in a concise and digestible manner, which is well-suited to presentation online.
* The material is easily expanded when writing the following resources:
  * Guidebooks (online and PDF)
  * Online Learning Environment Slides (and scripts for recorded lectures)
  * In-person courses
* It is easy to understand how sections and sub-sections relate to one another.
* It is easy to spot when a single section has too much content.

> **Note**
> Each section should be written with a single point in mind.
> This prevents rambling presentations during courses, and helps focus the material.
> As a rough guide, the content for each section should fit within a 5 minute (approximate) presentation.

To use the slide functionality is simple, and consists of using branches to separate content.
Please use the following to segment content:

`---` is for a new topic section
`----` is for a new sub-section within an existing topic

> **Example**
> he project lifecycle module is split into 5 sections, with 3 of these sections being about the over-arching stages of the model (e.g. `project design`).
>
> Within the `project design` section, a single stage (e.g. `data analysis`) represnets a topic section. Within this topic section, there are two sub-sections:
>
> 1. What is data analysis?
> 2. What are the ethically salient properties of this stage?
