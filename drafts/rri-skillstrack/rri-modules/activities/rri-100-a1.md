## Identifying Types of Responsibility

In the [first section](rri-100-1.md) of this module, you were introduced to four types of responsibility: 

- Moral Responsibility
- Legal Responsibility
- Professional Responsibility
- Societal Responsibility

Your first task is to identify an instance of each type as it relates to the case study you have selected.

**Tip**
The `Stakeholders` section of the case study may help you identify instances of each type of responsibility.
For example, if the case study is about a research project, you may find that the researchers have a professional and moral responsibility to the study participants, and a legal responsibility to the funding body.
