## Summary

[...]

## Learning Objectives

- Objective 1
- Objective 2

## Instructions

### Pre-requisites

To carry out this activity, you will need the following:

- A case study selected from our repository.
- An understanding of the project lifecycle model's stages and the typical tasks that are carried out within each stage.

### Steps

1. To start you will need to choose a question that represents an ethical challenge or dilemma.
2. Next, you will need to identify the moral agents and moral subjects that are involved in the scenario.
   - For each moral agent, you will need to identify the set of responsibilities that they have.
   - For each moral subject, you will need to identify the ways in which they may be affected that have moral significance.
3. Finally, you will need to consider any conflicts or trade-offs that arise within the context of this scenario. Such trade-offs may exists between a moral agent and a moral subject, or between moral agents where there is some collective responsibility.

### Example

> Should I eat meat?

Agent: Yourself
Responsibilities: minimise harm to animal welfare; reduce carbon emissions

Subject 1: Animals
Concerns: welfare and suffering due to factory farming

Subject 2: Future Generations
Concerns: environmental impact due to unsustainable animal agricultural practices

Subject 3: Farmers
Concerns: livelihood and income

Value Tension 1: Welfare of the animals and the environmental sustainability of present and future generations is in tension with the livelihood of farmers who depend on income from animal agriculture.

Value Tension 2: Welfare of animals and future generations is in tension with your (possible) satisfaction of eating meat or the time constraints on your ability to learn about and prepare new plant-based meals.

### Goals and Objectives

The goal here is not to try to resolve the tensions or solve the question.
Instead this activity has been designed as a warm-up exercise to get you thinking about the different components and processes involved in ethical reflection and deliberation.
Feel free to make use of the space provided by the time to explore different ideas, and challenge yourself to think about the different perspectives that may be involved.

### Tips and Guidance

- Your own life and work experiences are likely the best source of scenarios that you can use for this activity, as you will be highly familiar with them. But, be careful and try to identify the possible biases that you may bring to bear on the evaluation of the scenario.
- To better identify the relevant values for the scenario, think about what motivates the moral agents and subjects. What are their respective concerns, goals, or objectives?
- If you're struggling to identify conflicting values, you may need to consider a broader range of moral subjects.

## Assets

No additional assets are needed for this activity.

### Online
