Data-driven technologies are not designed, developed, or deployed in a vacuum.
Rather, they are embedded in a social and cultural context from which they cannot be isolated, and created by people with perspectives that are both indicative of and constrained by their own sociocultural context.

This plurality of perspectives can problematise the fair design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies because of the many different interpretations of what is fair.
For instance, for some people, fairness will prioritise the *reasonableness* of a system's behaviour, leading to practical emphasis on the transparency and accountability of the system's production.
For others, fairness will mean prioritising the equitable impact of the system, with a focus on prioritising users that are vulnerable or marginalised in the context of the system's use.
While these two notions of fairness are not incommensurable in the manner introduced at the start of this module (recall [Sen's example of the flute](rri-203-1.md)), their relative importance within a project can lead to diverging choices in the governance of a project (e.g. a highly transparent system that does not prioritise any group of users, or an opaque system that improves outcomes for a sub-group of users but in a way that is hard to explain).

----

This plurality can also be problematic for those wishing to learn about the fair design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies, because it can be difficult to know where to start.
The approach adopted in this section, therefore, will be to largely focus on a notion of fairness that emphasises the following considerations:

* Non-discriminatory and equitable impacts of the technology
* Awareness of a broader social justice context, even if it is not something that a project seeks to alter

** Other Sections in this Module **

Other sections will focus on different notions of fairness, relative to the perspective they emphasise, such as supporting the *reasonableness* of a system's behaviour through transparent and accountable decision-making (practical fairness).

## Levelling the Playing Field

Consider the following scenario.
You are organising a game of football with your friends against another team.
However, when you arrive on the day the teams are organised such that one team has access to the best players, the best equipment, and the highest level of fitness.
Furthermore, the football pitch is located in a field with an uneven surface, such that the gradient declines steeply towards your goal and the teams do not rotate the direction of play.

How would you feel about playing this game if you were on the team with the disadvantageous conditions?

----

Unless you like unreasonable challenges or find it fun to lose, you would probably not be very happy about this situation.
In fact you would probably feel that the game is unfair.
And, in arguing your case you would be able to point to several clear factors that make the game unfair:

- Variation in the levels of fitness between the teams
- Variation in the quality in the equipment
- Variation in the skills of the players
- An uneven playing field

----

Now, let's assume that the other team concedes to the (valid) reasons you have given for the game being unfair, and make certain concessions.
First, they ensure everyone has access to the same equipment.
Second, you all move to a different field with an even surface.

However, the composition of the teams remains the same.
After all, you came as a team and want to play together.
You go ahead with the game, and unsurprisingly, you lose.

----

In this toy example, some of the factors that contribute to the initial unfairness of the game are ones that can be easily resolved (e.g. access to equipment, uneven field).
But others remain harder to resolve, such as variation in skills.
Some would argue here that variation in skills and fitness is a natural part of the game, and that the game is fair in this sense once the other factors are resolved.

But what if we delve further into the historical factors behind this variation in skills and fitness?

Perhaps the other team come from a wealthy background, and have always been able to afford the best equipment and training facilities.
And, perhaps your team has a lower level of respiratory fitness, in part, because of high levels of pollution in the area where you live.

----

While the game is fairer in the adjusted scenario, it's still true to say that your team has been playing on an uneven field.
It's just that the field, here, is no longer the physical one; but a sociocultural one that spans back across many years.

In relation to data-driven technologies, sociocultural fairness is about identifying the factors (or, sociocultural determinants) that precede the choices made during a project's lifecycle but which affect the overall fairness of the technology.
In other words, before the game of the project lifecycle begins, how is the field already uneven and how can we level it to make sure that the game is fair?
And, once the game has finished, how do the results affect future games?

---- 

Let's call these factors "fairness factors" to help us further differentiate some sub-categories.
For instance, in the case of the football game, there is clearly a difference between these three conditions:

- Having an uneven playing field that slopes towards one team's goal
- Variation in the skills of the players
- One team being given orange squash at half-time and the other one being given blackcurrant squash

The first condition is highly discriminatory towards one of the teams, and has no place in a fair game of football.
In fact, the organising committee for this league may even have some regulation in place that prohibits this.
Let's call the set of fairness factors that are similar to this one as 'impermissible factors'.
Such factors are never permissible in a fair game (or, project).

The second condition, in the context of sport, is still a discriminatory factor like the firstâ€”that is, it plays some contributory role in determining or influencing the outcome of the game. However, although discriminatory in this sense, it is not necessarily *unfair*.
Whether it constitutes an unfair factor will depend on a broader range of social and historical factors (e.g. whether the variation is itself the result of unfair patterns of discrimination).
Therefore, let's call these fairness factors, 'potentially permissible factors' to highlight the need for further consideration and deliberation.

And, finally, the third factor seems utterly irrelevant to the outcome of the game and should, therefore, not be considered a 'fairness factor' at all.
We can, therefore, call this set of (non fairness) factors 'irrelevant factors'.
Needless to say, we won't spend much time on this final set.

----

Differentiating between the three sets of factors in this way helps draw attention to the importance of public reason giving, deliberation, and justification in the context of fair design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies.
That is, in many cases it will not be sufficient to just identify those factors that are impermissible due to some legal or regulatory requirement (e.g. protected characteristics).
In the remainder of this section, we will help illustrate this point by looking at three use cases of data-driven technologies, which intuitively seem to be unfair but where this may not arise due to some simple 'impermissible factor'.
In addition, each of the three factors we draw attention to is, in some sense, separable from the outcome of the game itself.

----

<!-- begin admonition -->
**Equality Act 2010 and protected characteristics**
The UKs Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against someone because of a protected characteristic. The set of protected characteristics are

- age
- disability
- gender reassignment
- marriage and civil partnership
- pregnancy and maternity
- race
- religion or belief
- sex
- sexual orientation

Such characteristics are often used as proxies for what we are calling 'impermissible factors'.
That is, they cannot be used (either directly or indirectly) as a means for discriminatory or prejudicial treatment.

### The Digital Divide (Who Gets to Play the Game?)

In our running analogy, one of the football teams had access to better equipment and training facilities.
The other team, in contrast, do not have the same access to high-quality resources.
As such, while both teams are able to train in principle, it is likely that the team with access ot better resources will be able to train more effectively or efficiently.

> Are there barriers to access that prevent some people from participating at the same level as others?

Barriers such as these, in the context of data-driven technologies, are factors that contribute to what is commonly referred to as the *digital divide*.
In short, this term refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not, as well as the varying levels of access inbetween.

A digital divide can exist in many forms, including:

- Differential access to the internet (e.g. variation in speed and reliability, barriers from higher costs)
- Differential access to compute resources (e.g. faster processors, more memory, etc.)
- Variation in digital literacy and skills (e.g. ability to think critically about online content, ability to manipulate data)

Evaluating the sociocultural fairness of data-driven technologies requires us to explore holistic factors that are not always *directly* linked to the outcomes of the technology itself.
Perhaps a team of developers are building an online app that recommends free activities in their local neighbourhood and uses data about their interactions to improve these recommendations over time.
To improve the security and data protection properties of the app, the developers decide to use edge computing techniques to process the data locally on the user's smartphoneâ€”thereby enhancing the user's privacy.
However, this builds in an requirement that use of the app will require a smartphone with a certain level of processing power.
In addition, the recommendations depend on a strong base of users in the local area, which may not be the case in some neighbourhoods.

As such, two seemingly innocuous (and perhaps even desirable) factors nevertheless create a divide that prevents some people from using the app.

<!-- insert dynamic example tabs in online guidebook for domain-specific examples of digital divides-->

Fairness factors that are related to the digital divide are often raised under the banner of *accessibility* concerns.
And, although there are some legal requirements or regulatory precedents that compel organisations to proactively consider and improve accessibility, because so many 'digital divides' arise without explicit forms of *impermissible* discrimination, they often go overlooked.

<!-- start admonition -->
**Poverty**

Epidemiologists and social scientists have long recognised that poverty is a key factor in determining outcomes in many areas of life (e.g. health, education, employment).
But, poverty is not a protected characteristic, and as such, despite many technologies implicitly discriminating against wide areas of society on the basis of economic conditions, there are few legal protections in place to ensure the use and implementation of technologies do not create unfair impacts on those who are already economically disadvantaged.

<!-- end admonition -->

To be clear, not all barriers to access are impermissible.
For instance, some systems or services may specifically target a group of people who are disadvantaged in some way (e.g. a web browser plugin that improves accessibility for people with visual impairments).
But, understanding and evaluating the socio-cultural fairness of data-driven technologies does require us to consider whether any barriers exist that prevent people from using the technology, and whether these barriers are permissible or not.

> Are any groups unfairly excluded from using the technology or benefiting from its use?

### Ghost Labour (Who Built the Field?)

Before a game of football can begin, the field must be prepared by a team of groundskeepers (whose work is often invisible to the players).
Who "get's to play the game" is, therefore, a matter that presumes the existence of a playable location.

> Who is responsible for maintaining the field, and is their labour fairly compensated?

In the context of data-driven technologies, especially those that purport to demonstrate *artificial* intelligence, a lot of the groundwork is done by teams of data cleaners, labellers, or annotators.
In some cases, this falls on the shoulders of junior members of a research team (e.g. research assistants).
In other cases, this tiring and laborious work is carried out by *ghost labourers*â€”people who work behind the scenes and are paid miniscule amounts for their work.

The example of OpenAI's ChatGPT model is a good example of this latter kind of work, but also illustrates another factor related to ghost labour: extraction of value from the work of others.
In January 2023, a Time article reported that OpenAIâ€”the company that developed ChatGPTâ€”used outsourced Kenyan laborers earning less than $2 per hour to help train the model by tagging and labelling data that was deemed toxic or offensive.
While the end goal here is laudable, the means by which it was achieved raises clear flags about the fairness of developing such a model.
In addition, the initial data used to train ChatGPT (and other models in OpenAI's library) depends on the availability of large amounts of data that is freely available on the internet.
While these data are 'public', and, therefore, likely permissible to reuse by others, the fact that they are freely available is, in part, a result of the work of others who are not compensated for their efforts.

Understanding and evaluating the sociocultural fairness of data-driven technologies, such as AI, require us to consider the ghost labour that enables them to demonstrate "intelligent" capabilities.

> How should those whose labour is responsible for the development of data-driven technologies be fairly compensated?

### Representation (How are the Different Teams Represented?

<!-- Which teams have the best marketing? -->

Returning to our running analogy, for the final time, and stretching the analogy to its very limits, let us consider how each of the teams were represented leading up to the game.
Let's pretend that because of their ongoing success one of the teams has a large marketing budget and receives the best forms of media representation.
While this may not directly affect the outcome of the game, it has certainly been something that the team have long found appealing and motivating.
In contrast, the other team has no marketing budget and have to rely on whatever coverage they receive, much of which is negative or false.

> There is a clear difference in the way that the two teams are *represented*. Is this difference unfair?

This final theme is somewhat different from the others we have considered so far.
Differential representation can lead to harmful physical consequences, such as a patient receiving the wrong treatment due to being misclassified by an algorithmic triaging system, or a person being wrongly sentenced to time in prison due to a biased algorithmic risk assessment system.
We will look at these consequences in more detail in the following sections.

However, fair representation matters in its own right.
That is, whether certain groups of people are more or less likely to be represented by a technology in a way they perceive to be fair is an issue with *intrinsic value*, and is independent from whether the mis-representation leads to harmful outcomes.
To see why, let's first consider the set of data-driven technologies that are used to classify people into groups.

Many data-driven technologies sort and classify people and objects into groups.
Some do this as a result of categories pre-selected by humans (e.g. demographic variables in a census), whereas others attempt to use forms of machine learning to organise people or objects into groups (or buckets) that are represented via a set of labels.

![]()
We will look at the consequences of this representation on practical decision-making in the next section, but for now let us consider the act of representation itself.

From the perspective of sociocultural fairness, two questions about representation precede matters that are more directly related to the outcomes of the technology:

- Who is represented?
- How are they represented?

The first question is very similar to the matter of *accessibility* that we considered earlier.
However, there is a difference between whether some group is *in principle* represented by a system, but practically unable to access it, versus a group that is not even represented.

## Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement

This section has focused on introducing some important conceptual distinctions, and, therefore, has largely set aside practical considerations.
We will address this limitation in the coming section, but two important points are worth mentioning here.

First, the primary means for identifying fairness factors that are relevant to a particular data-driven technology is through stakeholder engagement.
Furthermore, determining whether their influence on a project or system is permissible or impermissible will likely involve a similar process (e.g. consulting domain experts, seeking feedback from affected users).

However, and to the second point, stakeholder engagement can itself present barriers to accessibility for some groups.
For instance, if you choose to carry out stakeholder engagement workshops through a video conferencing platform, you may create your own digital divide that excludes those who do not have access to the internet or a computer.

Discussing these points in sufficient detail is beyond the scope of this section and module, but we do have a [separate skills track](#) that deals with engagement of stakeholders in the context of data science and AI projects.
