When digital artist Jason M. Allen of Pueblo West, Colorado created this image—titled, 'Théâtre D’opéra Spatial'—and entered it into the Colorado State Fair's annual art competition he caused a controversy.
The admittedly captivating image was in one sense of the term "created" by Mr. Alle, but not with the traditional software tools of a digital artist.
Instead, all it took for Mr. Allen to create this image was a single text prompt used as input for a generative AI model known as Midjourney.

Whereas digital art, like its more messy and organic counterpart, requires hours of painstaking work, works of art like the one above can be created in a matter of second, using carefully chosen prompt such as the following:

` /imagine prompt: unexplainable AI, surrealism style`

The results are often stunning, as is the case with 'Théâtre D’opéra Spatial', and not so much with the result of the much simpler prompt above:

But unlike the appealing and engaging mystery that lies behind the creation of traditional works of art, which mesmerise and captivate so many people, the primary mystery behind AI-created artwork is the fact that no one has any idea how the models actually work!

When Mr. Allen entered his image, the public response was mixed.
Notably, other artists whose livelihoods and welfare depend, in part, on the public valuing and appreciating the fruits of their labour were anxious and angry about the widespread adoption of AI-generated art.
