# Welcome

Hello ðŸ‘‹
This is the Turing Commonsâ€”a home for resources and tools to help you reflect, discuss, and take responsibility for the design, development, and use of data-driven technologies.

Confused by that last sentence?
Don't worry you're still in the right place.
We have a range of resources for those curious about the ethical and responsible use of data, regardless of whether you're a curious citizen looking to have greater control over local matters, or a data scientist looking to take more responsibility over the consequences of your research.

This site is a living resource, however, which means the content is constantly being updated, revised, and refined. At present, the site is a home for several skills tracks and guidebooks, which have been designed for specific training courses we are in the process of delivering.

You can acess them [here](skills-tracks/index.md)
