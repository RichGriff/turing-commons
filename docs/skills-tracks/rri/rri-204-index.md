# Explainability

<!-- This page should list learning objectives for this module and provide a summary. -->

> **Note for Index Page**
> This module is not a technical introduction to Interepretable ML methods, nor does it attempt to provide an up-to-date overview of the current methods in Interpretable ML or Explainable AI.
> New methods are currently being developed at a rapid pace, and many of these methods are designed to solve problems with specific techniques (e.g. integrated gradients and feature relevance for classificatory models).
> It is not possible, nor desirable, to keep these resources up-to-date with these sorts of developments.
> Rather, we aim to provide clarity on the practical and ethical consequences of explainability in data-driven technologies.
> As such, we discuss those methods (or classes of methods) that are well established and have wide applicability across domains and use cases.
