# Fairness

<!-- This page should list learning objectives for this module and provide a summary. -->

<!-- > **Note for Index Page** -->
<!-- > This module is not a technical introduction to Fair ML methods, nor does it attempt to provide an up-to-date overview of the current methods in the field. -->
<!-- > New methods are currently being developed at a rapid pace, and many of these methods are designed to solve problems with specific techniques (e.g. privacy-preserving federated learning to protect interest of vulnerable groups). -->
<!-- > It is not possible, nor desirable, to keep these resources up-to-date with these sorts of developments. -->
<!-- > Rather, we aim to provide clarity on the practical and ethical consequences of fairness in data-driven technologies. -->
<!-- > As such, we discuss those methods (or classes of methods) that are well established and have wide applicability across domains and use cases. -->
